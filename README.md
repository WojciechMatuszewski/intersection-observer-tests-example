# Unit testing `IntersectionObserver` API

Most of the things that has to do with the `IntersectionObserver` API should be tested using tools like _Cypress_.
This is because we can only do so much in _JSDOM_ environment.

Having said that, there is still value to unit tests. These can ensure that there are no memory leaks and so on.
This repository contains example on how to do that :)
